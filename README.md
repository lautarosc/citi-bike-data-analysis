# Citi Bike Data Analysis

Project made as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics for Beginners Course. 
The goal of this project is to better understand the behavior of Citi Bikeâ€™s customer base (both one-time
users and subscribers) and how they use Citi Bikes.

As part of this course I: 

* Learned about the overall process and steps that are implemented in Data Analytics, and what a career in the field entails. 
* Worked with a real-world data set (provided by Citi Bikes). 
* Cleaned raw data, removed duplicates and handled missing data from a real data set. 
* Conducted exploratory data analysis, calculated descriptive statistics and created pivot tables in order to better understand the data.
* Created data visualizations (data viz) in order to summarize and present key findings in a succinct, accessible format.
* Crafted a compelling narrative for my data story, resulting in a polished, professional presentation, ready to share with stakeholders.

I have uploaded the Presention in PDF and PPTX (Powerpoint). I have also uploaded the cleaned, final version of the data set used.
